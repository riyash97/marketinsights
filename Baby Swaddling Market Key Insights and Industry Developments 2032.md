The global Baby Swaddling Market is experiencing a remarkable surge, driven by increasing awareness about infant safety, rising demand for premium baby care products, and the growing emphasis on promoting better sleep for newborns. According to a recent report by Dataintelo, the market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% from 2023 to 2032, reaching a valuation of USD 1.2 billion by the end of the forecast period.
Swaddling, a traditional practice of wrapping infants snugly in blankets or specialized fabrics, has gained widespread popularity due to its ability to mimic the womb environment, providing comfort and reducing the startle reflex in babies. This has led to a surge in demand for innovative and ergonomic swaddling products, particularly in developed regions.
